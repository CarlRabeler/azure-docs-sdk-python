  summary: 'Defines matching criteria to determine whether a service should be

    included as a child of an application in the cluster health chunk.

    The services are only returned if the parent application matches a filter

    specified in the cluster health chunk query description.

    One filter can match zero, one or multiple services, depending on its

    properties.
