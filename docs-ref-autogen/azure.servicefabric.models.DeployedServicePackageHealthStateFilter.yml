  summary: 'Defines matching criteria to determine whether a deployed service package

    should be included as a child of a deployed application in the cluster

    health chunk.

    The deployed service packages are only returned if the parent entities

    match a filter specified in the cluster health chunk query description.

    The parent deployed application and its parent application must be

    included in the cluster health chunk.

    One filter can match zero, one or multiple deployed service packages,

    depending on its properties.

        If not specified, all deployed service packages that match the parent

        filters (if any) are taken into consideration and matched against the
