  summary: 'Defines matching criteria to determine whether a deployed application

    should be included as a child of an application in the cluster health

    chunk.

    The deployed applications are only returned if the parent application

    matches a filter specified in the cluster health chunk query description.

    One filter can match zero, one or multiple deployed applications,

    depending on its properties.

        If specified, the filter is applied only to the application deployed on

        the specified node.

        If the application is not deployed on the node with the specified name,

        no deployed application is returned in the cluster health chunk based on

        this filter.

        Otherwise, the deployed application is included in the cluster health

        chunk if it respects the other filter properties.

        If not specified, all deployed applications that match the parent filters

        (if any) are taken into consideration and matched against the other

        filter members, like health state filter.

        For example, it can specify a filter to return all deployed service
