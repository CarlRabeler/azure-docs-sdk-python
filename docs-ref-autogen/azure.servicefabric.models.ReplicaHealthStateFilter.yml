  summary: 'Defines matching criteria to determine whether a replica should be

    included as a child of a partition in the cluster health chunk.

    The replicas are only returned if the parent entities match a filter

    specified in the cluster health chunk query description. The parent

    partition, service and application must be included in the cluster health

    chunk.

    One filter can match zero, one or multiple replicas, depending on its

    properties.

    - description: 'Id of the stateful service replica

        or stateles service instance that matches the filter. The filter is

        applied only to the specified replica, if it exists.

        If the replica doesn''t exist, no replica is returned in the cluster

        health chunk based on this filter.

        If the replica exists, it is included in the cluster health chunk if it

        respects the other filter properties.

        If not specified, all replicas that match the parent filters (if any) are

        taken into consideration and matched against the other filter members,

        like health state filter.
