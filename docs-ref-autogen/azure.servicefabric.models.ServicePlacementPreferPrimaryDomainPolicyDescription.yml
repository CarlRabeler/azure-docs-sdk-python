  summary: "Describes the policy to be used for placement of a Service Fabric service\n\
    where the service's Primary replicas should optimally be placed in a\nparticular\
    \ domain.\nThis placement policy is usually used with fault domains in scenarios\n\
    where the Service Fabric cluster is geographically distributed in order\nto indicate\
    \ that a service\uFFFDs primary replica should be located in a\nparticular fault\
    \ domain, which in geo-distributed scenarios usually\naligns with regional or\
    \ datacenter boundaries. Note that since this is an\noptimization it is possible\
    \ that the Primary replica may not end up\nlocated in this domain due to failures,\
    \ capacity limits, or other\nconstraints.\n.\n"
