This is the summary of Authorization page. Below is just an example of include Java code snippet.

The following sample code uses the synchronous version of the API, but the concepts are the same:

```java
EventHubClient client = createFromConnectionStringSync(final String connectionString)("connection");
PartitionReceiver receiver = client.createPartitionReceiverSync("ConsumerGroup1", "1"); 
Iterable{<}EventData{>} receivedEvents = receiver.receiveSync();

while (true) 
{ 
    int batchSize = 0; 
    if (receivedEvents != null) 
    { 
        for(EventData receivedEvent: receivedEvents) 
        { 
            System.out.println(String.format("Message Payload: %s", new String(receivedEvent.getBytes(), Charset.defaultCharset()))); 
            System.out.println(String.format("Offset: %s, SeqNo: %s, EnqueueTime: %s", receivedEvent.getSystemProperties().getOffset(), receivedEvent.getSystemProperties().getSequenceNumber(), receivedEvent.getSystemProperties().getEnqueuedTime())); 
            batchSize++; 
        } 
    } 

    System.out.println(String.format("ReceivedBatch Size: %s", batchSize)); 
    receivedEvents = receiver.receiveSync(); 
} 
```
